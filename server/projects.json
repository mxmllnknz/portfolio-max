      "description": "I worked as the project designer and lead engineer for a debit card rewards program. Using a stack of Next.js, Go, and Postgres, I launched this project from the ground up and within six months, converted our existing user base (2000+ users) and handling $200,000+ in transactions. In addition to the UI and server aspects of the project, I also implemented fraud prevention using Plaid's Auth and Identity products.",

      "description": "I am a part-time machine learning course instructor at Inspirit AI. I have taught 300+ high school students from all over the world about the fundamentals of artificial intelligence as well as the ethical considerations it necessitates. I have supervised these students' learning progress, culminating in technical presentations on projects such as using neural networks to find exoplanets in NASA datasets and using principal component analysis to predict where Covid strains originate. I also implemented an AWS solution that allowed in-person students limited to Chromebooks to access Jupyter Notebooks via their browsers.",

      "role": "Student Researcher",
      "description": "While I'm limited by an NDA to a vague description of this project, it has been one of my favorites because of the out-of-the-box mindset we had to adopt to solve the problem. In order to prevent avenues to fraud, we embraced the fraudster mindset and worked backwards. We designed a semi-automated web interface script to perform repeated actions on potentially dangerous targets and automatically extracted the requisite data from those actions. This would cut down the amount of manual work current industry professionals were doing.",
